My programm is the answer to the exercise which was created by ChatGPT:

## Student Grading System (With LINQ) ##
Create a class Student with properties like Name, RollNo, and Grades (a list of integers).

Implement methods to:
-	Add grades to a student
-	Calculate the average grade
-	Determine the highest and lowest grades
-	Sort students based on their average grade using LINQ.
-	Filter out students who have failed (below 50).
